    Hi my name is Iqrah
    And I'm a nobody.
    Nobody with a body.

    I go by the name iiqrah
    Let me tell you a little bit about my internet persona.

    I love creating content.
    Be it in the form of code, video or doodles.
    Sometimes inspired or straight-up copied, but most of the time, original.

    I like to sing, dance and play.
    Be it badminton or my recently bought ukulele.

    I used to be a really shy timid gal.
    But that changed when I was introduced to the world of hackathons by a pal.

    Then I founded helloHackers and ManMetHacks.

    And was the first to be

    a Code First: Girls Ambassador and GitHub Campus Expert, at my uni.

    However, those titles mean nothing much to me
    as I still don't know who I truly am or want to be.

    I love coding but I'm not great at it.
    I think I love fame and success, but I don't have it (yet).

    I want to learn, share and inspire.
    But still haven't figured out what I ultimately desire.

    Hope you know a little more about me now,
    I guess all that's left to say now is ciao.

    If you want to connect,
    shoot me an email or text?

    K bye.
