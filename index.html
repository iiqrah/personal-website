    Hi my name is Iqrah. <br>
    And I'm a nobody. <br>
    Nobody with a body. <br>

<br>
    On the interwebs, I go by the name iiqrah,<br>
    so let me tell you a little bit about my internet persona.<br>

<br>
    I love creating content. <br>
    Be it in the form of code, video or doodles. <br>
    Sometimes inspired or straight-up copied, but most of the time, original. <br>

<br>
    I like to sing, dance and play. <br>
    Be it badminton or my recently bought ukulele. <br>

<br>
    I have been a shy timid gal. <br>
    But that has changed a lot,
    since I was introduced to the world hackathons by a pal. <br>

<br>
    Then I founded helloHackers and ManMetHacks. <br>
    And was the first one at my uni to be <br>
    an Ambassador for Code First: Girls (and a GitHub Campus Expert) <br>

<br>
    However, those titles mean nothing much to me <br>
    as I still don't know who I truly am or want to be. <br>

<br>
    I want to learn, share and inspire. <br>
    But still haven't figured out what I ultimately desire. <br>

<br>
    Hope you know a little more about me now. <br>
    There might be more to come from me, so watch out. <br>

<br>
    If you want to connect, <br>
    shoot me an email or a text? <br>
    But other than that, all I have left to say is: <br>

<br>
    K bye. <br>

<br>
<br>
