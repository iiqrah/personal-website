    Hi my name is Iqrah. <br>
    And I'm a nobody. <br>
    Nobody with a body. <br>

<br>
    I go by the name iiqrah <br>
    Let me tell you a little bit about my internet persona.<br>

<br>
    I love creating content. <br>
    Be it in the form of code, video or doodles. <br>
    Sometimes inspired or straight-up copied, but most of the time, original. <br>

<br>
    I like to sing, dance and play. <br>
    Be it badminton or my recently bought ukulele. <br>

<br>
    I used to be a really shy timid gal. <br>
    But that changed when I was introduced to the world of hackathons by a pal. <br>

<br>
    Then I founded helloHackers and ManMetHacks. <br>

<br>
    And was the first to be <br>

<br>
    a Code First: Girls Ambassador and GitHub Campus Expert, at my uni. <br>

<br>
    However, those titles mean nothing much to me <br>
    as I still don't know who I truly am or want to be. <br>

<br>
    I love coding but I'm not great at it. <br>
    I think I love fame and success, but I don't have it (yet). <br>

<br>
    I want to learn, share and inspire. <br>
    But still haven't figured out what I ultimately desire. <br>

<br>
    Hope you know a little more about me now, <br>
    I guess all that's left to say now is ciao. <br>

<br>
    If you want to connect, <br>
    shoot me an email or text? <br>

<br>
    K bye. <br>
